  <p>I am an Economist (YP) in the World Bank's Governance Global Practice currently working on the West and Central Africa region.
    I am also a research affiliate with <a href="https://mitgovlab.org/">MIT GOVLAB</a> as well as a member of the World Bank's <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/impactevaluation/programs/bureaucracy-lab">Bureaucracy Lab</a>. 
     I have a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a B.A. in political science and economics from Swarthmore College.
     I originally joined the World Bank through the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/careers/programs-and-internships/young-professionals-program">Young Professionals Program</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I conduct both academic-focused and policy-focused research in collaboration with colleagues internal to and external to the World Bank. 
    I am broadly interested in how politics influences public administration, public financial management, and public procurement. 
    I have worked on these issues in many low- and middle-income countries, but I have a particular interest in the West Africa region. 
  </p>
    
  <p>Most of my research projects leverage large, administrative datasets scraped from government records, though I also have extensive training in randomized experiments, behavioral games, and survey design.
    My research has been funded by the <a href="https://mitgovlab.org/">MIT GOVLAB</a>, the <a href="http://cis.mit.edu/">MIT Center for International Studies</a> and the <a href="https://pmlab.mit.edu/">MIT Political Methodology Lab</a>. 
    Beyond MIT, my research has been generously supported by the <a href="https://www.westafricanresearchassociation.org/">West Africa Research Association</a>, the <a href="https://gld.gu.se/">Governance and Local Development Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting Partnership</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Prior to graduate school and the World Bank, I worked for the public health non-profit <a href="https://www.psi.org/">Population Services International</a> in Dakar, Senegal and the <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid">Center for International Development at Harvard University</a> in Cambridge, MA. 
    During graduate school, I worked for <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/">IDinsight</a> and the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime">Development Impact Evaluation</a> group at the World Bank. 
  </p>  
   
  <p>
    I am fluent in French and have lived and worked in France, Senegal, and Morocco. 
    I have also conducted extensive field work in many countries across sub-Saharan Africa.
